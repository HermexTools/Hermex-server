## Hermex-server
KSUploader is a instant sharing tool.
This is the runnable server side. If you would know what the client can do please read the correspondent [readme](https://github.com/HermexTools/Hermex-client/).

UPDATE: The server is now compatible with all clients that supports uploads via HTTP POST and TCP Socket that match the protocol used by HermexServer.

### How to install
Actually simply run it one time to generate the `server.properties`: a config file.
To run the server you can use: `java -jar Hermex-server.jar`.

### How to configure
Open and edit the `server.properties` file, then launch the server again.
It contains:
* `folder`: the folder where the files will be stored, use a dot (.) to say "this directory".
* `web_url`: the complete domain directory that will be returned in the link to the client. Include a final slash.
* `password`: the password of the server that is required during the authentication check.
* `port`: the port where the server will accept new connections.
* `folder_size(MB)`: the max size in MB of the entire server folder.
* `max_file_size(MB)`: the max size in MB of a file that the server will accept.
* `web_port`: the port used by webserver for serving files and accept HTTP uploads.

>Attention: all config properties must be not null, even if you don't use one of them.

>Disclaimer: this is a project in early development stage. Since that it may change at any time.
